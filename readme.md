## Some comments
- We've updated a bit after demo  
- Also you can take a look at our demo video with beautiful music!  (Since the size is too big you can view it by https://mycuhk-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/1155077061_link_cuhk_edu_hk/EVyaz_sDCmlHpAhAeFNG94gBap28noXFyZkK9HKRFikG6w?e=GdFhWs)  
- For our commit history, sorry that our commit history after initial code is gone. I'm not very familiar with git bash so I accidentally used git init so all commit history is gone.
